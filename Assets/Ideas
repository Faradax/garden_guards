Drafting and Buying
 - The Shop offers 5 items upon the start of the game.
 - Each new wave, items are drafted until 5 items are on offer.
 - Each item can be bought individually in exchange for coins.
 - The entire draft can be replaced (once per wave / once per red coin / for exponentially increasing prices?)

Can placing Towers make Game harder?
 - Tower sprays bugs golden -> give more money, but 3x HP
 - Some with Friendly Fire (Cannon, Confusion Wave, Fire, etc)
 - Towers attract additional (resistant?) monsters
 - Downsides could outscale Tower count ("For every 2 Gun Towers, X spawns twice")
 - Unique Downsides ("Every 10 exploding Cannonballs, a Mole spawns")
 - Towers can get damaged & be destroyed
 - Towers in Pairs?
 - Some damage types can buff certain monsters
